ABOUT

Wolpertinger is a subtractive synth with a sharp bandpass filter whose center
frequency "bounces" around the frequency of the playing notes. Thanks to the
Juced library it can be used both as a standalone application supporting JACK
or ALSA audio outputs, and as a VST instrument.

VERSIONS

0.2 MIDI parameter changes now update the GUI
    Binaries no longer linked to OpenGL
    Debug and Release binaries included
0.1 Initial Release


INSTALLATION

The executable binary should run out of the box, no installation needed. The 
VST shared object (.so) is meant to be loaded into VST-compatible host 
applications, e. g. Renoise.


SOURCE CODE

You can pull the source from the SVN repository. A standard Makefile for GNU 
make and Code::Blocks project files are included. It may be possible to create
files for other build environments from the included premake4 script. You can 
get premake4 from http://industriousone.com/premake .


DEPENDENCIES

You need the Juced library to compile the code. You can get Juced from 
http://code.google.com/p/juced/

Note that you need the VST 2.4 SDK if you want to build the VSTi. Steinberg's 
license forbids redistribution, so I can't include the SDK. 
It's free "as in beer" though: you can get it from http://www.steinberg.net/ 
after doing whatever Steinberg wants you to do (mostly providing a valid email 
address and staring at their ads for a while).
